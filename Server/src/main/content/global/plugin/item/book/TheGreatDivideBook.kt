     * The great divide, written by Cerridwyn Cadarn, is a book which goes on
     * to tell of a time when the Underground Pass was found to be blocked off
     * and, after sending scouts to try to discern what was going on, the elves
     * of the eastern regions found that during their absence, Prifddinas had
     * fallen into a gruesome, bloody civil war, with Lord Iorwerth seizing
     * control of much of the city. The book ends with the elves travelling to
     * return to the city. The book can be found on the shelves in your house after
     * the completion of Mourner's End Part 1.
