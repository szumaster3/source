     * The turkey book is a book that players could obtain as part of the
     * 2008, 2014, 2015, and 2016 Thanksgiving events. It gives clues on
     * where to find disguised turkeys around Gielinor, which players could
     * find and spy on. Spying on all ten during the events unlocked the Give
     * Thanks emote. Players could obtain the book from the cook's brother in
     * Lumbridge Castle. The book itself gives no instructions, and players must
     * rely on dialogue from the cook's brother to know what the locations
     * mean and what they should look for.
