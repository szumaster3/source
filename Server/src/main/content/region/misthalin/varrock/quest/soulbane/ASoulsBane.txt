     * Description:
     * Tolna was a young boy when he left his home in Varrock in search of a more exciting
     * lif away from his parents. He travelled northeast of Varrock, but did not make it far.
     * Shortly after leaving his home, Tolna discovered a strange crevice in the woods
     * northeast of the city. As he moved closer to investigate, he fell in, where he would
     * be imprisoned for the next twenty-five years. Tolna's emotions caused the rift to
     * change. His emotions, which were mostly anger, confusion, fear, and hopelessness,
     * were manifested in the caverns' chambers. Tolna descended further into madness and
     * ultimately lost his humanity.
