/**
 * Once killed, you will be rewarded with 5 phoenix quills (upon talking to the phoenix) and 5000 Slayer experience,
 * from every kill after that you will only receive 500 Slayer experience. In addition, in subsequent visits you will
 * also receive 7500 Firemaking experience, 3000 Fletching experience, as well as 1000 Crafting experience as a reward
 * for defeating her.
 * <p>
 * Once you have completed the quest, and have 51 Slayer, you may fight the Phoenix after traveling through her lair (Her guardians will block and multi-attack you, be warned.)
 * <p>
 * The Phoenix herself has a Combat level of 235 and has high defence. She attacks purely with magic and has been said to hit up to 29.
 * <p>
 * Note: Your familiar RARELY follows you through the whole set of caves.
