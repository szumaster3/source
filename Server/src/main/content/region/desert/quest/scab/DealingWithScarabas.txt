//The ability to craft an Enchanted water tiara - protects you from the Desert heat effect
//To craft an enchanted tiara, use water runes on a normal water tiara (they will be stored inside the tiara); every time the player takes a 'drink', the total number of water runes stored in the tiara will decrease by three.
//Destroy the enchanted tiara to get the normal water tiara and remaining water runes backâ€”they will drop on the ground.
//You can only have one enchanted water tiara at any given time.
//2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)
