//1 quest point
//10,000 Combat experience, as a combat XP lamp, in Attack, Constitution, Defence, Magic, Ranged, or Strength.
//Demonic sigil (can be used to chant any number of times even after the quest)
//Demonic tome (updated in your bookcases)
//Silverlight turns into Darklight: It is even more powerful against demons. If a player loses Darklight, it can be retrieved by talking to Gideon Bede at Varrock's north church. You must have him replace Silverlight for you first.
//If you didn't do so in The Golem, you can loot the demon throne at the north end of the room to obtain 2 emeralds, 2 sapphires, and 2 rubies
//2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)
