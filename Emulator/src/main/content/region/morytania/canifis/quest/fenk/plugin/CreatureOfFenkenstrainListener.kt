    TODO: Check, remove content from later revisions, until implementation of Garden of Tranquillity normal ring also work.

    Transportation

    The ring of charos (a) has the following uses for transportation:

     - [ ] Free boat trips between the Karamja, Ardougne, and Port Sarim ports.
     - [ ] Free trips to the Piscatoris Fishing Colony (unnecessary after completion of Swan Song as travel becomes permanently free).
     - [1/2] Reduced cost for Magic carpets to 100 coins, or 75 coins once a Rogue Trader completion.
     - [x] Reduced Charter Ship costs (the prices are a half of the original price, or a quarter if Cabin Fever is completed).
     - [ ] Free boat rides from Mort'ton to the middle of Mort Myre.

     Quests

     - [ ] Used in The Great Brain Robbery (the inactivated version also works).
     - [ ] Get the recipe for Asgoldian ale for free during Recipe for Disaster: Freeing the Mountain Dwarf and the ability to do the quest again.
     - [ ] Can be used instead of a fish to bribe one of the penguins during Cold War.
     - [ ] Cheaper snake charming kit in Pollnivneach for The Feud.
     - [ ] Charm farmers to get various unique seeds for Garden of Tranquillity.
     - [ ] Get the dirty laundry during While Guthix Sleeps.
     - [ ] Used on Ali Morrisane to obtain the original name of the Pharaoh Queen in Missing My Mummy.
     - [ ] Used to convince Ali Morrisane to tell you the location of some lost goods during Do No Evil.
     - [ ] An additional chat option to charm Milton the Miller during The Chosen Commander.
     - [ ] Can be used in Heroes' Quest instead of 1,000 coins when getting Master thief's armband solo as a Phoenix Gang member.

     Other

    - [x] The residents of Canifis will think you are a werewolf and will be nice to you (the inactivated version will grant this as well).
    - [ ] Dwarven Ferryman's fee for taking gold to bank near the Dondakan's mine reduced from 20% of gold ores to 10%.
    - [ ] Reduced Blast Furnace cost (for those with less than 60 Smithing).
    - [ ] Ability to convince Brundt the Chieftain to change your Fremennik name.
    - [x] Ability to convince the Fossegrimen south-west of Rellekka into accepting bass in place of shark to charge your enchanted lyre with 20 teleports.
    - [x] Used to access the Werewolf Agility Course (the inactivated version will grant this as well).
    - [ ] Sell grey wolf fur for 150 coins instead of 120 coins to Baraek in Varrock fur stall.
    - [ ] Sell molten glass for 25 coins instead of 20 coins to Fritz the Glassblower on Entrana.
    - [ ] 50% Luke will tell the story of how he lost half of his body.
    - [ ] Get more information out of Movario and Darve (also requires a Pendant of Lucien and has not yet started While Guthix Sleeps).
    - [ ] Choose the colour of your kitten from Gertrude.
    - [ ] Wizard Elriss will tell more about her research in the Runecrafting Guild (any colour of the full runecrafter robes must also be worn).
    - [ ] Beefy Bill will bank your beef, cowhide, and flour for free.
       1. Transfer flour, cowhides, and raw beef to the bank, charging a 10% commission [?] (rounded up),
         or for free if charmed with an activated ring of charos.
       2. If players use coins on him, he will say "Thanks!" and they will lose 1 coin.
       3. If players try to bank cooked beef, he will say "It's unhygienic to mix raw and cooked meats." and he will not bank it.
       4. If players try to bank raw undead beef, he will say, "Woah! Whatever that thing is, I'm not transporting it."
    - [ ] Can be used for prosecution in Court Cases for those with lower than 65 Attack. Also gives insight into jury members' backgrounds and motives on the jury selection screen.
    - [ ] Though he's not weak minded, the Wise Old Man will tell you more about his partyhat.
    - [ ] The sellers of Capes of Accomplishment will ask for 92,000 coins instead of the usual 99,000 when buying a Cape of Accomplishment.
    - [ ] The only exception to this is the Quest Cape, as the Wise Old Man is not weak-minded. Asking to buy the Quest Cape with the ring equipped will result in some humorous dialogue instead.
    - [ ] During the 2006 Christmas event when speaking to Shanty Claws, he will say something like: "Oh, I didn't think I'd see another werewolf here."
